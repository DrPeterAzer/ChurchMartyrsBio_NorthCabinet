    <h2>From Tagaste to Carthage</h2>
    <p>On November 13, 354 AD, in the city of Tagaste in Numidia, North Africa, Augustine was born. His father, Patricius, was a harsh pagan, while his mother Monica was a Christian who endured the cruelty of her husband and mother-in-law with amazing patience. Through her long-suffering, she won them both over, and her husband accepted the faith and was baptized shortly before his passing.</p>
    <p>His father's only concern was to see his son become wealthy and educated. His pagan teachers paid no attention to students' behavior, so Augustine grew up careless, lazy, and undisciplined. At the age of sixteen, his father sent him to Carthage to train in rhetoric. There, he fell in with bad company and became a ringleader, boasting of his wickedness. His life turned to theaters and immorality.</p>
    <p>In his studies, he focused on law and jurisprudence, aspiring to become a lawyer or judge. He mastered Latin to the point of opening a school for rhetoric at the age of nineteen. Augustine admired the philosophy of Cicero, reading his book "Hortensius," which awakened in him a desire for chastity and the search for truth. He also read the Bible, but not with a spirit of faith and humility—instead, with pride. This led him to fall into the heresy of Manichaeism.</p>
    <p>When Monica saw her son deviate morally and doctrinally, becoming a stumbling block to many, she expelled him from her home. But out of love, she brought him back, and her tears never dried as she prayed for his salvation. St. Monica saw a dream where she stood on a wooden plank (symbolizing faith), filled with sorrow. A radiant young man appeared to her, shining with joy, and asked the reason for her sadness. When she answered, he said: "Take heart and fear not. Behold, your son is here with you." She turned to find Augustine standing with her on the plank and knew God had heard her prayers.</p>

    <h2>In Rome</h2>
    <p>In 382 AD, his friends urged him to travel to Rome for greater glory and wealth. His mother tried to stop him, and when she failed, she decided to travel with him. He tricked her, saying he was going to bid a friend farewell on the ship, then departed, leaving her in tears.</p>

    <h2>In Milan</h2>
    <p>The governor of Milan requested a rhetoric teacher from the Roman governor, who sent Augustine. Divine providence arranged his meeting with St. Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, who received him with love. Augustine admired his sermons for their eloquence, though he initially did not care for their spiritual depth. He heard St. Ambrose’s spiritual interpretations of the Old Testament—books which the Manicheans dismissed—as well as his refutations of Manichaeans and other heresies. The light of truth began to shine.</p>
    <p>Here, Augustine realized the Church bore marks of being from God: it fulfilled Old Testament prophecies, manifested spiritual perfection, performed miracles, and spread despite persecution. Monica sailed to Milan, where her son met her and told her he had left Manichaeism, though he had not yet embraced true faith, being enslaved to lust, thinking chastity was impossible. Augustine began reading some Platonic books translated into Latin by Victorinus, which benefited him but did not lead him to faith. He returned to reading the Bible, especially St. Paul’s letters, which impressed him by connecting the Old and New Testaments. Divine providence brought him to Simplicianus, with whom he shared his reading of Platonic philosophy. Simplicianus was pleased and told him that Victorinus had become a devout Christian. Augustine was inspired by this but still bound by sinful habits.</p>

    <h2>His Conversion</h2>
    <p>A devout high-ranking official named Ponticianus visited him and found him and his friend Alypius reading some of St. Paul’s letters. Mistaking them for philosophy books, he asked about them, and Augustine explained he had been reading them deeply. Their conversation led to the story of St. Anthony the Great and how two nobles, upon hearing it, left everything to follow Christ. Augustine’s heart burned with jealousy—how could the unlearned seize the Kingdom of God while he, a scholar, wallowed in sin?</p>
    <p>After Ponticianus left, Augustine went to the garden next to his house, threw himself under a fig tree, and cried out: "A great storm... defend me... and You—how long? How long, Lord? Will You be angry forever? Do not remember the sins of my youth. I feel enslaved by them. How long? Until tomorrow? Why not now? Why not end my impurity this very hour?" He wept bitterly. That was in 386 AD. He was 32 years old when his life changed by God’s grace. His destructive energy turned into burning love.</p>
    <p>Augustine returned to Alypius and together they went to Monica, telling her her 30 years of prayers were finally answered, and the prophecy of St. Ambrose was fulfilled. By God’s grace, Augustine decided to leave rhetoric teaching and dedicate his life to God's Word and service. He retreated with his mother, Alypius, his (illegitimate) son Adeodatus, some cousins, and friends to Cassiciacum near Milan. He stayed there six months preparing for baptism. At the beginning of Lent in 387 AD, he went to Milan and was baptized by Bishop Ambrose. It is worth noting that the tree he wept under was likely an olive tree, and in modern Algeria, there remains an olive tree in that district known as “St. Augustine’s Olive Tree.”</p>

    <h2>Monica’s Passing</h2>
    <p>St. Augustine traveled with his son, mother, brother, and Alypius to Ostia to await a ship home. His mother told him her mission was fulfilled, having seen him a faithful servant of the Lord. Five days later, Monica caught a severe fever. After fainting and regaining consciousness, she told her sons: "Where was I? ... Here you shall bury your mother." With those words, she gave her soul into God’s hands.</p>

    <h2>In Rome and Africa</h2>
    <p>After St. Monica’s death, they decided to return to Rome. There, Augustine fought against Manichean heresy. He then traveled to Africa, visiting Carthage and Tagaste, where he distributed all his possessions and withdrew for three years of worship and meditation, writing many books.</p>

    <h2>His Ordination as Priest</h2>
    <p>While visiting a nobleman in Hippo (modern-day Annaba, Algeria), the bishop ordained him a priest despite his tearful reluctance. He preached most days of the week. He lived in a church-owned garden and turned it into a monastery full of devout monks. He also founded a convent for nuns under his sister’s care.</p>

    <h2>His Ordination as Bishop</h2>
    <p>In 395 AD, he was appointed co-bishop to Valerius, bringing joy to the faithful, but provoking heretics who stirred unrest and tried to kill him. This saintly bishop was known for his deep love for the poor. He sometimes sold church possessions to help the needy and free prisoners. He fought heresies and attended a council called by Emperor Honorius in 421 AD, where he debated 279 Donatist bishops and led many back to true faith.</p>

    <h2>His Passing</h2>
    <p>At 72, he appointed a priest to manage church affairs, hoping he would succeed him. He spent four years preparing for death and passed away in 430 AD at age 76, with tears never ceasing.</p>

    <h2>His Writings</h2>
    <p>He authored around 232 books. These include historical works like <em>Confessions</em> and <em>Retractations</em>, philosophical essays like <em>Against the Academics</em>, <em>The Happy Life</em>, <em>The Immortality of the Soul</em>, <em>On Music</em>. He also wrote polemical works against Jews, pagans, Manicheans, Donatists, Pelagians, and Origenists. His biblical commentaries include Genesis, Psalms, 1 John, the Sermon on the Mount, Gospel harmony, Galatians, Romans, and John. He also wrote ascetical and ethical works.</p>

<h3>His Childhood and Youth</h3>
  <p>
    Saint Augustine, who used commonly to be called Austin in English, was born on November 13, 354 at Tagaste, a small town of Numidia in north Africa, not far from Hippo. His father, Patricius, was a pagan and of a violent disposition; but through the example and prudent conduct of his wife, Saint Monica, he was baptized a little before his death.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a child, Saint Monica instructed him in the Christian religion and taught him how to pray; falling dangerously ill, he desired baptism and his mother got everything ready for it: but he suddenly grew better, and it was put off.
  </p>
  <p>
    His father wanted him to become a man of learning and cared very little about his character. In his writings, Augustine accuses himself of often studying by constraint, disobeying his parents and masters, not writing, reading, or minding his lessons so much as was required of him; and this he did not for lack of wit or memory, but out of love of play. But he prayed to God with great earnestness that he might escape punishment at school. He later on did so well with his studies that he went to Carthage in 370 when he was still 17. He studied rhetoric with eagerness and pleasure; but his motives were vanity and ambition, and to them he joined loose living.
  </p>

  <h3>Years Away from Christ</h3>
  <p>
    At Carthage, he entered into relations with a woman (to whom he remained faithful until he sent her away from him 15 years later). She bore him a son, Adeodatus, in 372. His father had died in 371, but he continued at Carthage and switched to philosophy and the search for the truth. He also studied the Scriptures but from a subjective attitude. He was offended with the simplicity of style, and could not relish their humility or penetrate their spirit. Then he fell into Manichaeism – a combination of pagan religions and philosophy. The darkening of the understanding and clumsiness in the use of the faculties helped to betray him into his company; and pride did the rest. “I sought with pride”, he says, “what only humility could make me find. Fool that I was, I left the nest, imagining myself able to fly; and I fell to the ground.”
  </p>
  <p>
    For nine years he had his own schools of rhetoric and grammar in Tagaste and Carthage, while his devoted mother, Saint Monica, spurred on by the assurance of a holy bishop that “the son of so many tears could not perish”, never ceased by prayer and gentle persuasion to try to bring him to conversion and reform.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 383 he departed to Rome, secretly, lest his mother should prevent him from going to the big city. He opened a school of rhetoric, and then was appointed by the government as a teacher in Milan, where his mother, and his friend Alipius joined him. Saint Monica’s only ambition was to convert her son to Christianity.
  </p>

  <h3>His Repentance</h3>
  <p>
    In Milan, Saint Augustine came under the influence of Saint Ambrose the bishop; he began to go to his sermons, not so much with an expectation of profiting by them as to gratify his curiosity and to enjoy the eloquence. He found that the discourses more learned than the heresies he adopted and began to read the New Testament especially Saint Paul’s writings. In the same time, the mother of Adeodatus his son left back to Africa leaving the child behind.
  </p>
  <p>
    Saint Augustine’s spiritual, moral and intellectual struggle went on; he was convinced of the truth of Christianity, but his will was weaker than the worldly temptations, and delayed his return to Christ for many months. “Soon, in a little while, I shall make up my mind, but not right now” he kept telling himself. In his half desires of conversion he was accustomed to beg of God the grace of chastity, but was at the same time in some measure afraid of being heard too soon. He realized that his problem was a moral one. The Divine truth for which he was seeking would never be his unless he first overcame his weakness.
  </p>
  <p>
    Soon after, Pontitian, an African, came to visit Saint Augustine and his friend Alipius; he told them about two men who had been suddenly turned to the service of God by reading about the life of Saint Anthony. His words had a powerful influence on the mind of Saint Augustine. He was ashamed his will has been so weak and said to Alipius:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    “What are we doing to let the unlearned seize Heaven by force, whilst we with all our knowledge remain behind, cowardly and heartless, wallowing in our sins? Because they have outstripped us and gone before, are we ashamed to follow them? Is it not more shameful not even to follow them?”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    He rushed to the garden, greatly upset; tears filling his eyes, he threw himself on the grass under a fig tree and reproached himself bitterly crying out:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    “And Thou, O Lord, how long? How long? Is it to be tomorrow and tomorrow? Why not now? Why not this very hour put an end to shame?”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    As he spoke these words he heard a child’s voice singing “Tolle lege! Tolle lege!” (Take up and read! Take up and read!). He could not remember any childhood game he played with any such words. He remembered that Saint Anthony was converted from the world by hearing a single verse. He took up Saint Paul’s epistles and read the first chapter that met his eyes: 
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    “Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying. But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, fulfil the lusts thereof.” (Romans 13:13-14)
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    When he told Alipius what he had experienced, Alipius took the book and read, he found the next words to be: “Him that is weak in the faith receive ye” and applied them to himself and joined his friend in his resolution.
  </p>
  <p>
    This high point in the conversion of Saint Augustine took place in the September of 386, when he was 32 years old. He, his son Adeodatus and Alipius were baptized by Saint Ambrose at Easter the following year in the presence of Saint Monica. She knew that her prayers were answered and died shortly after.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    “Too late, have I loved Thee, O Beauty so ancient and so new, too late have I loved Thee! Thou wast with me, and I was not with Thee; I was abroad, running after those beauties which Thou hast made; those things which could have no being but in Thee kept me away from Thee. Thou hast called, Thou hast cried out, and hast pierced my deafness. Thou hast enlightened, Thou hast shone forth, and my blindness is dispelled. I have tasted Thee, and am hungry of Thee. Thou hast touched me, and I am afire with the desire of thy embraces.”
  </blockquote>

  <h3>A Priest and then a Bishop</h3>
  <p>
    From that time, Saint Augustine went back to Tagaste, his native city, and lived for three years with his friends and shared a life of prayer, study and poverty. All things were in common and were distributed according to everyone’s needs. He had no idea of becoming a priest, but in 391 he was ordained as an assistant to Valerius, Bishop of Hippo, and he had to move to that city.
  </p>
  <p>
    He established a sort of monastery in his house, living with Saint Alipius, Saint Evodius, Saint Possidius and others according to the rule of the holy Apostles. Valerius who had an impediment in speaking appointed Saint Augustine to preach in his own presence and he has not interrupted the course of his sermons until his death (nearly 400 sermons). He vigorously opposed the Manicheans and the Donatists.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 395 he was consecrated bishop as co-adjutor to Valerius, and succeeded him in the see of Hippo on his death soon after. He established regular and common life in his episcopal residence, and required all the priests, deacons, and subdeacons to renounce property following the regular mode of life recognized by the early Church as instituted by the Apostles.
  </p>
  <p>
    He founded a community of religious women and on the death of his sister, the first “abbess”, he addressed a letter on the general ascetic principles of the religious life; this letter is known as the “Rule of Saint Augustine”.
  </p>
  <p>
    He employed the revenues of his church in relieving the poor and in redeeming the captives. Like another Moses or Saint Paul, he said to his people: “I do not want to be saved without you. What shall I desire? What shall I say? Why am I a bishop? Why am I in the world? Only to live in Jesus Christ: but to live in Him with you. This is my passion, my honor, my glory, my joy and my riches.”
  </p>
  <p>
    There is a good example of Saint Augustine’s modesty and humility in his discussion with Saint Jerome over the interpretation of a text of Galatians. Owing to the miscarriage of a letter Saint Jerome, not an easily patient man, deemed himself publicly attacked. Saint Augustine wrote to him: “I entreat you again and again to correct me confidently when you perceive me to stand in need of it; for though the office of a bishop be greater than that of a priest, yet in many things Augustine is inferior to Jerome.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Through his 35 years as a bishop of Hippo, Saint Augustine had to defend the faith against one heresy or another. He opposed the Donatists, the Pelagians, and the Alarians. In order to finish his valuable writings, and to provide against a troublesome election after his death, he proposed to his clergy and people to choose for his co-adjutor Heraclius, the youngest among his deacons, and his election was confirmed by acclamation in 426.
  </p>
  <p>
    Saint Augustine calmly resigned his spirit into the hands of God on August 28, 430, after having lived 76 years and spent almost 40 of them in the labors of the ministry. Among his greatest work is the 15 volume “On the City of God” which took him 30 years to write, and his “Confessions”.
  </p>

  <p><strong>May the prayers and supplications of the great Saint Augustine be with us. Amen.</strong></p>

    <h2>من تاجست إلى قرطاجنة</h2>
    <p>في 13 نوفمبر 354 م. بمدينة تاجست من أعمال نوميديا بأفريقيا الشمالية وُلد أغسطينوس، وكان والده باتريكبوس وثنيًا فظ الأخلاق، أما والدته مونيكا فكانت مسيحية تحتمل شرور زوجها وحماتها بصبر عجيب، وبطول أناتها كسبت الاثنين حتى أن رجلها قبل الإيمان واعتمد قبيل نياحته.</p>
    <p>كان كل همّ والده أن يرى ابنه رجلًا غنيًا ومثقفًا، وكان معلموه الوثنيين لا يهتمون بسلوك التلاميذ، فنشأ أغسطينوس مستهترًا في حياته ميالًا للكسل. إذ بلغ السادسة عشرة من عمره أرسله أبوه إلى قرطاجنة ليتمهر في البيان، هناك التقى بأصدقاء أشرار، وصار قائدًا لهم يفتخر بالشر، فتحولت حياته إلى المسارح والفساد.</p>
    <p>أما عن دراسته فقد عكف على دراسة الفقه والقوانين مشتاقًا أن يرتقي إلى المحاماة والقضاء، وقد تضلع في اللاتينية حتى افتتح مدرسة لتعليم البيان وهو في التاسعة عشرة من عمره. أعجب أغسطينوس بمذهب شيشرون، فقرأ كتابه "هورطانسيوس" الذي أثار فيه الشوق إلى العفة والبحث عن الحق. قرأ أيضًا الكتاب المقدس لكن ليس بروح الإيمان والتواضع وإنما في كبرياء، فأغلق على نفسه وسقط في "المانوية".</p>
    <p>إذ رأت مونيكا ابنها قد انحرف سلوكيًا وعقيديًا، وصار عثرة لكثيرين طردته من بيتها، لكن بمحبتها ردته ثانية، وكانت دموعها لا تجف طالبة خلاص نفسه. رأت القديسة مونيكا في حلم أنها واقفة على قطعة خشبية (ترمز للإيمان) والكآبة تشملها، وإذ بفتى يلمع بهاؤه أمامها ويشع الفرح من محياه ينظر إليها ويسألها عن سبب حزنها، وإذ أجابت، قال لها: "تعزي ولا تخافي، فها ولدك هنا وهو معك". التفتت مونيكا لتجد ابنها واقفًا معها على الخشبة، فتأكدت أن الله استجاب طلبتها.</p>

    <h2>في روما</h2>
    <p>في عام 382 م. أوعز إليه أصدقاءه بالسفر إلى روما لينال مجدًا وغنى أعظم، فحاولت والدته صده وإذ لم تفلح عزمت على السفر معه. احتال عليها بقوله أنه ذاهب ليودع صديقًا له على السفينة، فسافر تاركًا إياها غارقة في دموعها.</p>

    <h2>في ميلانو</h2>
    <p>أرسل حاكم ميلان إلى حاكم روما يطلب أستاذًا في البيان، فبعث إليه أغسطينوس، وقد دبرت له العناية الإلهية الالتقاء بالقديس أمبروسيوس أسقف ميلان، الذي شمله بحبه وحنانه فأحبه أغسطينوس وأعجب بعظاته، وكان مداومًا على سماعها لما فيها من قوة البيان دون اهتمام بالغذاء الروح الدسم. سمع من القديس أمبروسيوس تفاسيره الروحية للعهد القديم الذي كان المانيون يتجاهلونه، كما سمعه في رده على أتباع ماني وغيرهم من الهراطقة، فبدأ نور الحق ينكشف أمامه.</p>
    <p>أبحرت مونيكا إلى ميلان ليلتقي بها ابنها ويبشرها بترك المانوية، لكن دون قبوله الإيمان الحق، إذ كان منهمكًا في الشهوات، حاسبًا حفظ العفة أمرًا مستحيلًا. بدأ أغسطينوس يقرأ بعض كتب الأفلاطونيين التي نقلت عن اليونانية بواسطة فيكتريانوس، التي انتفع بها لكنها لم تقده للإيمان. عاد يقرأ الكتاب المقدس خاصة رسائل معلمنا بولس الرسول فأعجب بها خاصة في ربطها العهد القديم بالعهد الجديد...</p>

    <h2>توبته</h2>
    <p>زاره مؤمن حقيقي من كبار رجال الدولة يدعى بنسيانس، فوجده مع صديقه أليبوس وبجوارهما بعض رسائل معلمنا بولس الرسول، فظنها أحد الكتب الفلسفية، لكن أغسطينوس أخبره بأن له زمانًا لا يشغله سوى مطالعة هذه الأسفار، فدار الحديث بينهما حتى تطرق بنسيانس لسيرة القديس أنبا أنطونيوس وكيف تأثر بها اثنان من أشراف البلاط فتركا كل شيء ليسيرا على منواله، وهنا التهب قلب أغسطينوس بالغيرة...</p>

    <h2>نياحة مونيكا</h2>
    <p>سافر القديس أوغسطينس مع ابنه ووالدته وأخيه وأليبوس إلى أوستيا منتظرين السفينة للعودة إلى وطنهم، وكانت الأم تتحدث مع أغسطينوس معلنة بأن رسالتها قد تحققت برؤيتها له كخادم أمين للرب. بعد خمسة أيام مرضت مونيكا بحمى شديدة، وإذ أُغمى عليها وأفاقت قالت لابنيها: "أين كنت أنا؟... هنا تدفنان والدتكم"... قالت هذا ثم سلمت روحها في يدي الله.</p>

    <h2>في روما وأفريقيا</h2>
    <p>بعد نياحة القديسة مونيكا قرروا العودة إلى روما، حيث جاهد أغسطينوس هناك لدحض بدعة المانويين. ومن هناك انطلق إلى أفريقيا حيث ذهب إلى قرطاجنة ثم إلى تاجست، فوزع كل ممتلكاته واختلى للعبادة والتأمل في كلمة الله ثلاث سنوات، ووضع كتبًا كثيرة.</p>

    <h2>سيامته كاهنًا</h2>
    <p>إذ كان أغسطينوس يزور رجل شريف بمدينة هيبو (تدعى حاليًا إيبونا من أعمال نوميديا) سامه الأسقف كاهنًا بالرغم من محاولته رفض السيامة بدموع، بل وجعله يعظ أكثر أيام الأسبوع. سكن في بستان ملك الكنيسة وجعله ديرًا حيث امتلأ بالرهبان الأتقياء، كما أنشأ ديرًا للراهبات تحت تدبير أخته.</p>

    <h2>سيامته أسقفًا</h2>
    <p>أقيم أسقفًا مساعدًا لفاليروس عام 395 م. الأمر الذي أفرح قلوب المؤمنين، وإن كان الهراطقة قد حزنوا وأثاروا شغبًا ضد الشعب وحاولوا قتله. امتاز هذا الأسقف القديس بحبه الشديد للفقراء حتى كان يبيع أحيانًا ما للكنيسة ويوزعه على الفقراء ويحرر به المسجونين. واهتم بدحض أصحاب البدع. حضر مجمعًا بأمر الملك أونريوس عام 421 م. ضم 275 أسقفًا مؤمنًا و279 من الدوناتيين، فجادلهم وأردهم إلى الإيمان المستقيم.</p>

    <h2>نياحته</h2>
    <p>إذ بلغ من العمر 72 عامًا استعان بأحد الكهنة في تدبير أمور الكنيسة راغبًا أن يكون خليفته، وبقى 4 أعوام يستعد للرحيل، وفي عام 430 م. تنيح وهو في سن السادسة والسبعين، وكانت دموعه لا تتوقف.</p>

    <h2>كتاباته</h2>
    <p>بلغت حوالي 232 كتابًا، منها كتبه التاريخية مثل "اعترافاته" و"الاستدراكات"، ومقالاته الفلسفية مثل "الرد على الأكاديميين" و"الحياة السعيدة"، "خلود النفس"، "في الموسيقى"... وأيضًا أعماله الجدلية ضد اليهود والوثنيين، وضد أتباع ماني وضد الدوناتيين وضد البيلاجيين وضد الأوريجانيين، كما قدم كتبًا في تفسير التكوين والمزامير والرسالة الأولى إلى يوحنا، والموعظة على الجبل، وعن اتفاق الإنجيليين، وتعليقات على الرسالة إلى أهل غلاطية والرسالة إلى أهل رومية وإنجيل يوحنا. كما كتب كُتب في النسكيات والأخلاقيات...</p>
