    He lived during the time of Pope Yoannis XIII. He was born in the town of Hour, in the Mallawi district of Minya Governorate. His parents were God-fearing and raised him with true spiritual upbringing. They knew how to deeply instill the faith within him so firmly that he would never accept anything in its place.
    (You can find more about these saints on the St-Takla.org website under the sections of Saints’ Biographies, Synaxarium, Church History, and the Sayings of the Fathers.)

  <p>
    <strong>His Marriage and Virginity:</strong> When he reached adulthood, his parents thought of choosing a wife for him from among his relatives and arranged his marriage against his will. However, the saint did not have marital relations with his wife, and they both remained virgins, protected by divine providence and overshadowed by the angel of the Lord.
    After his marriage, he began wandering through the mountains and deserts, visiting monasteries and comforting his pure soul with the fellowship of saints, monks, and devout worshippers. When his family found him, they bound him in iron chains to prevent him from leaving again. But they witnessed the chains miraculously fall from his feet, and the locks opened on their own by the power of the Lord Christ who dwelled in him.
    He would spend his days and nights in continuous prayer. His only wish was to plead with the Mother of God, the Virgin Mary, to help him attain the crown of martyrdom for the name of her beloved Son. The Virgin Mary appeared to him in a dream and informed him that his request had been granted, and that he would receive his desire, with the pure Archangel Michael guarding him.

  <p>
    <strong>His Martyrdom:</strong> A group of unbelieving rioters seized him and brought him before the ruler of the land for declaring his faith in the Lord Christ. He was subjected to insults, humiliation, and beatings. They also stoned him because of his steadfastness and open confession of Christ. But he was not harmed, as the angel of the Lord was protecting him.
    The governor threw him into prison, but whenever the jailer put shackles on his feet, they would miraculously come off, and he was found unbound. He confessed his faith in Christ before the governor of Egypt, who then sent him to the noble King Qansuh al-Ghuri. The saint remained steadfast in his faith, so the king sent him to the judges. They decided to execute him and parade him in chains throughout the land and streets of Egypt. This sentence was carried out, and after a bitter struggle, his head was cut off on the 3rd of Kiahk, year 1229 A.M. (Coptic calendar), and he received the crown of martyrdom.

<p>On Kiahk 3 of the year 1229 of the martyrs (1512 A.D.) St. Bestavros (Saleeb - the new martyr) was martyred. This saint was born in the city of Ebshadat which was nearby the city of Hor, district of Mallawy, and was called Saleeb.</p>

  <p>He learned the church subjects, and when he became a young man he desired to live a life of virginity. Nevertheless, his parents wed him against his will to one of his relatives. He found that his wife had the same inclination to the life of celibacy so they agreed to live together under one roof in complete virginity.</p>

  <p>Saint Saleeb (Bestavros) spent most of his times with the monks in the nearby monastery listening to their advices, persevering on praying interceding by the Virgin to aid him in his spiritual struggle.</p>

  <p>One day a group of wicked men falsified many untrue accusations against him that he blasphemed against the Islamic faith. However, he openly declared his faith in the Lord Christ so they imprisoned him.</p>

  <p>The wife of the jailer saw him from the prison’s window praying all night long. She also saw a luminous woman appeared before him and said; “Be patient for you shall receive the crown of martyrdom and the Archangel Michael will support you.”</p>

  <p>The ruler of the area, later on, sent him to Cairo shackled with chains. He was on the boat for few days without food or drink persevering in praying and the Virgin St. Mary appeared to strengthen him.</p>

  <p>When he arrived to Cairo they brought him before the King Al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghury and the saint confessed the Lord Christ again before him. He was enraged and sent him to the judge to pass a sentence against him.</p>

  <p>When the judge realized his insistence on courageously confessing the Lord Christ, he sentenced to put him to death and delegated that to one of the Mameluke princes. They made a wooden cross and nailed St. Bestavros (Saleeb) on it then raised him crucified on the back of a camel and paraded him around the streets of Cairo.</p>

  <p>He rejoiced for he was counted worthy to suffer shame for the name of Christ. Later on they took him off the camel and promised to release him if he forsook his confession of the Lord Christ. However the saint shouted saying; “I will die a Christian on the name of our Lord, God, and Savior Jesus Christ.”</p>

  <p>The prince ordered to behead him thus he received the crown of martyrdom. His body remained for three days in the middle of a fire they prepared however his body did not burn.</p>

  <p>Some of the believers came and took his pure body and brought it to the papal residence. Pope Youannes (John) XIII received him with great veneration in the antiquated church of the Virgin Mary in Haret Zuwaila in old Cairo and kept it there.</p>

  <p>During the papacy of Pope Shenouda III, the 117th patriarch, he permitted the bishop of Mallawy, Anba Demetrius to relocate a part of the relics of St. Bestavros to the church of the Virgin St. Mary in the city of Ebshadat and that was on the 15th of Paone, 1703 A.M. (1987 A.D.).</p>

  <p><strong>May the blessing of his prayers be with us all. Amen.</strong></p>

    <strong>نشأته :</strong> كان في عهد البابا يوأنس الثالث عشر، وقد ولد في بلدة هور مركز ملوي محافظة المنيا، وكان والداه خائفي الرب، فربّياه تربية روحية حقّة، وعرفا كيف يجعلان العقيدة تترسخ في أعماقه فلا يرضى بها بديلًا. (ستجد المزيد عن هؤلاء القديسين هنا في موقع الأنبا تكلا في أقسام السير والسنكسار والتاريخ وأقوال الآباء).
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>زواجه وبتوليته :</strong> لما بلغ سن الشباب فكّر والداه في اختيار زوجة له من أقاربه وزوّجاه رغم إرادته، ولم يعرف القديس امرأته وظلاّ بتولين تحرسهما العناية الإلهية ويظلّلهما ملاك الرب.
    عقب زواجه صار يتجوّل في الجبال والبراري ويزور الأديرة ويعزّي نفسه الطاهرة بعِشرة القديسين والنسّاك والمتعبّدين. ولما عثر عليه أهله قيّدوه بالحديد حتى لا يفارقهم، ولكنهم رأوا أن هذه القيود قد انحلّت من قدميه وانفتحت أقفالها من نفسها بقوة السيد المسيح الحالة فيه.
    كان يواصل ليله بنهاره بالصلوات، وكانت أمنيته الوحيدة التوسّل لوالدة الإله القديسة مريم أن تعينه على نيل إكليل الشهادة على اسم ابنها الحبيب، فظهرت له السيدة العذراء مريم في حلم وأفهمته أن طلبه أجيز وسيحصل على أمنيته وسيكون رئيس الملائكة الطاهر ميخائيل في حراسته.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>استشهاده :</strong> قبض عليه جماعة من الغوغاء غير المؤمنين وقدّموه لحاكم البلاد لإعلانه إيمانه بالسيد المسيح، فانهالت عليه الشتائم والإهانات واللطمات، كما رجموه نتيجة تمسّكه واعترافه بالسيد المسيح، فلم يُصِبه شيء لأن ملاك الرب كان يحرسه.
    أودعه الحاكم في السجن، فكان كلّما وضع السجَّان الحديد في رجليه يجده حرًا طليقًا، وقد اعترف بإيمانه بالسيد المسيح أمام والي مصر، الذي أرسله للملك الأشرف قانصوه الغوري، وظل معترفًا ومتمسكًا بإيمانه فأرسله الملك إلى القضاة الذين قرّروا إعدامه وإشهاره في أرض مصر وشوارعها مكبّلًا بالحديد وتمّ تنفيذ ذلك. وبعد جهاد مرير قُطِعت رأسه في 3 كيهك سنة 1229ش، ونال إكليل الشهادة.
